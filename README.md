SQL Performance Tuning: Mastering Query Optimization
Performance tuning is a crucial aspect of SQL that ensures your database queries run as efficiently as possible. Whether you're dealing with OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems or OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads, optimizing SQL queries can significantly reduce execution times, minimize resource consumption, and improve user experience. This guide covers a comprehensive range of SQL performance tuning techniques, from basic indexing strategies to advanced optimization for distributed systems and large datasets.

In this repository, you’ll find:

Step-by-step performance tuning techniques, explained with examples and best practices.
SQL execution order to better understand how queries are processed internally.
Strategies for optimizing joins, indexing, partitioning, and working with large datasets.
Insights into query execution plans, statistics, and maintenance tasks that impact performance.
By following these techniques, you can identify bottlenecks in your queries, implement scalable solutions, and improve the overall efficiency of your database operations.

SQL Execution Order
Understanding SQL's logical query processing order is fundamental to writing optimized queries. SQL queries don’t execute in the order they are written but rather follow a defined sequence of steps:

```
SQL_Execution_Order/
├── 1_FROM/             # Identify the source tables and apply joins.
├── 2_WHERE/            # Filter rows based on conditions.
├── 3_GROUP_BY/         # Group the filtered data for aggregations.
├── 4_HAVING/           # Filter grouped data based on aggregate conditions.
├── 5_SELECT/           # Retrieve columns or computed results.
├── 6_DISTINCT/         # Remove duplicate rows from the result.
├── 7_ORDER_BY/         # Sort the result set.
├── 8_LIMIT_OFFSET/     # Restrict the number of rows returned.
```
